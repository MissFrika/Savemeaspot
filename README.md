# Savemeaspot
Save Me a Spot is a project made by 2 students, Frida Sj√∂gren and Andreas Ericsson, as a part of a University course. 
The application's primary function is to serve as a simple tool to add custom placemarkers on a map and easily find directions to them.
The application works on Android devices with an API level of 15 and up and requires GPS or an Internet connection.
Save Me a Spot uses Google Maps API to handle map functionality, and thus you can easily view saved locations in Google Maps and get all the navigational services that Google Maps provide.
